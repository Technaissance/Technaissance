          <p>
            Welcome to Technaissance, a project created for the course "Web Technologies". This page is designed to
            showcase the different tools and techniques learned in class, including HTML, markup, JavaScript, CSS, and
            others.</p>

          <p>The main goal of Technaissance is to provide a platform for users to explore the relationship between
            technology and art. Through the use of four distinct styles - Cyberpunk, Brutalism, Cowboy, and Minimalism -
            users can discover how technology has shaped the way we experience and create art.</p>

          <p>The page features three articles, each delving into a different aspect of the role of technology in art.
            Whether you're interested in the history of digital art, the latest developments in artificial intelligence
            and generative art, or the ways in which technology is transforming the art world, Technaissance has
            something for you.</p>

          <p>So, take some time to explore the different styles, read the articles, and discover how technology and art
            intersect. We hope you enjoy your visit to Technaissance!</p></span>

          <h3 class="issue">Text Markup Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            Technaissance page has been marked up using five different classes applied to span elements. These classes
            are "people", "technical terms", "events", "keywords" and "quotes". These classes are used to create a
            more interactive and engaging reading experience for the user, by making it easy to quickly identify and
            understand key elements of the text.</p>

          <p> To accomplish this, we utilized different JavaScript scripts to create checkbox elements on the page. When
            a user selects one of these checkboxes, the corresponding class is displayed as a list element on the
            page, allowing the user to easily navigate and identify the different types of information contained in
            the text.</p>

          <p> In addition to the functionality described earlier where the checkboxes allow the user to view the
            different classes as a list element, the list elements themselves are also interactive. When a user
            selects a list element, the corresponding text on the page is highlighted and the user is automatically
            navigated to that location in the text.</p>

          <p>This approach allows the user to easily navigate and understand the text in a way that is not possible
            with traditional static text. It also gives the user the ability to customize their reading experience and
            focus on the information that is most relevant to them.</p>

          <p>So, the main idea is to make the text more interactive, engaging and easy to understand for the user. With
            the use of checkboxes and classes, the user can easily navigate and identify key elements of the text,
            giving them a more meaningful reading experience.</p>

            <h3 class="issue">Documentation Of Cyberpunk Theme</h3>
            <p>
              The Cyberpunk theme is heavily influenced by the aesthetic of classic cyberpunk movies such as Akira and
              Blade Runner, as well as modern examples like Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

            <p>This theme is characterized by the use of neon and other vibrant colors, as well as a futuristic,
              technologically advanced aesthetic. The goal of this theme is to evoke the sense of a modern, high-tech
              metropolis, with all of the advanced technology and sleek design that entails.</p>

            <p>A key element of the Cyberpunk theme is the use of neon and other bright, eye-catching colors. This is
              used to create a sense of modernity and energy, as well as to draw the user's attention to different
              elements on the page. Additionally, the use of a muted, desaturated color palette creates a feeling of
              decay and decadence, evoking the darker side of a high-tech future.</p>

            <p>In the theme we also want to reflect the idea of the divide and disparities in society, as well as the
              loss of privacy and individuality that are characteristic of the cyberpunk genre, so we apply a lot of
              overlapping of different layers and use of glitch effect.

          <section>
            <h5 class="issue" id="section3.1">Theme History</h5>
            <p>The history of the Cyberpunk theme can be traced back to the 1980s, with the publication of the
              groundbreaking science fiction novel "Neuromancer" by William Gibson. This novel, along with others from
              the same era such as "Blade Runner" and "Akira," helped to define the cyberpunk genre, characterized by
              high-tech advancements set against a dystopian backdrop.
            </p>
            <p>The cyberpunk aesthetic quickly spread to other forms of media, including film, comics, and video games.
              In the 90s, movies such as "The Matrix" and "Ghost in the Shell" helped to solidify the genre's popularity
              and influence. The cyberpunk aesthetic also heavily influenced the development of the cyberculture and
              cyber-subcultures, in the early days of internet.
            </p>
            <p>In more recent years, the release of the video game "Cyberpunk 2077" has once again brought the cyberpunk
              aesthetic to the forefront of popular culture. The game's aesthetic, which draws heavily from classic
              cyberpunk sources, has served to re-popularize the genre and inspire a new generation of creators.

          </section>
          <section>
            <h5 class="issue" id="section3.2">Inspirtation Sources</h5>
            <p>
              <p>The Cyberpunk theme has been heavily influenced by a variety of sources, both in the realm of science
                fiction and in popular culture. Some of the most notable influences on the cyberpunk aesthetic include:
              </p>
              <p>- Science fiction literature: The cyberpunk genre was originally born out of science fiction literature
                in the 1980s, with novels such as "Neuromancer" by William Gibson, "Do Androids Dream of Electric
                Sheep?" by Philip K. Dick and "Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson. These novels helped to establish the core
                themes and aesthetic of the cyberpunk genre, such as high-tech advancements in a dystopian society.
              </p>
              <p>- Cyberpunk film: Cyberpunk-inspired movies like Blade Runner, the Matrix and Ghost in the Shell have
                also played a significant role in shaping the cyberpunk aesthetic. These films brought the aesthetic of
                cyberpunk literature to a wider audience, and popularized many of the visual and thematic elements
                associated with the genre.
              </p>
              <p>- Cyberpunk subculture: The cyberpunk aesthetic has also been heavily influenced by the cyberpunk
                subculture, which emerged in the early days of the internet. This subculture, which is associated with
                hacking, programming and a DIY attitude, is known for its rebellion against the status quo and its
                emphasis on individualism and personal freedom.
              </p>
              <p>- Video games: Video games like Deus Ex, Syndicate and more recently, Cyberpunk 2077, have been hugely
                influential in maintaining the popularity of the cyberpunk aesthetic and inspire a new generation of
                creators. The immersive nature of the gameplay in these games has made the worlds they depict feel
                incredibly real, providing an unmatched level of immersion into the cyberpunk genre.</p>

            <h5 class="issue" id="section3.3">Mood-Board For Theme</h5>
            <p> This Pinterest pin serves as a mood board for the Cyberpunk theme. We used it to capture the various
              visual and aesthetic
              elements associated with the cyberpunk genre, providing inspiration for the overall look and feel of the
              theme.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the key characteristics of the cyberpunk aesthetic that can be seen in the Pinterest pin include:
            </p>
            <p>- Futuristic technology: The cyberpunk aesthetic is heavily influenced by the idea of a high-tech,
              advanced future. This can be seen in the images of sleek, futuristic buildings and technology on the mood
              board.
            </p>
            <p>- Neon and other bright, vibrant colors: The use of neon and other bright, eye-catching colors is a key
              element of the cyberpunk aesthetic. This can be seen in the various images of neon lights, holographic
              displays, and other brightly colored elements on the mood board.
            </p>
            <p>- Dystopian elements: The cyberpunk genre is known for its dystopian themes, and this can be seen in the
              images of decrepit, run-down cityscapes and other elements on the mood board.

            <h5 class="issue" id="section3.4">Design System</h5>
            <p>
              <p>The design system for the Cyberpunk theme of Technaissance project is based on the latest version of
                Bootstrap, a popular open-source toolkit for building responsive and mobile-first web pages. Bootstrap
                provides a solid foundation for the project's layout and design, while allowing for customization to
                create the unique cyberpunk aesthetic.

              </p>
            </p>
            <h6 class="issue">Typographic Families</h6>
            <p>FONT FAMILIES</p>
            <p>The font family chosen for the Cyberpunk theme of the Technaissance project is a combination of Rajdhani,
              Advent Pro, and PT Mono. Rajdhani, a clean and elegant sans-serif font, is used for the headers and navbar
              elements, giving a futuristic and technology-inspired feel. Advent Pro, a versatile font with a geometric
              and modern look, is used for the headers, giving a bold and sharp appearance to the text. PT Mono, a
              monospace font, is used for body and general text, providing a clean and distinctive look, which matches
              with the cyberpunk aesthetic and the feeling of a high-tech future.</p>
            <p>HEADERS AND THEIR WEIGHTS</p>
            <p>The headers are designed to reflect the hierarchy of importance of the different titles throughout the
              page. We used six different types of headers, ranging from largest to smallest, by order of importance. To
              further emphasize the importance of the these elements, we used two unique styles to display them. The
              first style uses a glitched effect, adding a dynamic and futuristic feeling to the text. The second style
              uses a tilting underline, placed after the last word of the header, adding a unique and striking visual
              element to the text, providing an additional layer of emphasis and a cohesive cyberpunk aesthetic.
            </p>
            <P>PARAGRAPH TYPES</P>
            <p>The paragraph styles used in the Cyberpunk theme of the Technaissance project are designed to prioritize
              responsiveness of the page. The styles are in a free form which allows flexibility and adaptability to
              different devices and screen sizes</p>
            <h6 class="issue">Color Styles</h6>
            <p>The color scheme used is heavily influenced by the neon aesthetic of the genre. The primary colors used
              are yellow, cyan and red, creating a vibrant and eye-catching feel. Black is used as the secondary color, 
              providing a darker and more subdued contrast.Gradients, primarily red and black, are used to create a sense of depth and movement throughout the
              design. Opacity is mainly used in the gradients to add a subtle, translucent effect. Tints and shades of
              the primary colors are also used throughout the design, to create a cohesive and harmonious visual
              experience that fits the cyberpunk theme.
            </p>

            <h6 class="issue">Shape Styles</h6>
            <p>The shape styles used in the Cyberpunk theme of the Technaissance project mostly follow a cybernetic aesthetic, with round typography and organic shapes. But also use of lines are implemented to add more of a technological feel. Borders are mostly used for cards, providing a clear visual separation between different elements on the page, and adding a cyberpunk edge to the overall design. This creates a consistent, cohesive look that fits well with the overall theme of the project.
            </p>

            <h6 class="issue">Effect Styles</h6>
            <P>
              <p>The Technaissance project features the following design elements in regards to shadows and image manipulation:</p>
              
                <p>-Shadows: Shadows are used mainly for cards, providing depth and dimension to the elements, and highlighting the cyberpunk aesthetic. </p>
                <p>-Image manipulation: Images used throughout the project are made responsive and with transparent backgrounds. This allows them to adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes while preserving the look and feel of the design.</p>
              </ul>
            </P>

            <h6 class="issue">Logo Styles</h6>
            <p>A consistent logo is used across the website, ensuring a recognizable brand identity.</p>
            <h6 class="issue">Cursor Styles</h6>
            <p>The default cursor style is maintained, providing a familiar and consistent user experience.</p>
            <h6 class="issue">Icons Styles</h6>
            <p>There is no use of icons in this design, but the quotes are designed in a chrome style to match the overall cyberpunk aesthetic.</p>
            <h6 class="issue">Notification/Alert Styles</h6>
            <p>The default style is used for notifications and alerts, providing a consistent look and feel throughout the website</p>

            <p>
            The Cowboy theme of Technaissance project is a web page that evokes the style of the American West, with influences from Spaghetti Westerns. The theme is characterized by the use of warm colors such as red, yellow, and brown, which help to create a rustic and authentic feeling. The aesthetic is heavily influenced by classic western movies and traditional western iconography, with elements such as horses, guns, and cowboy hats featured prominently throughout the design. The theme aims to bring a sense of the wild west, with a touch of nostalgia and adventure.</p>

            <h5 class="issue" id="section4.1">Theme History</h5>
            <p>The history of the Cowboy theme can be traced back to the late 19th century, with the settlement of the
              American West and the rise of the cowboy as a cultural icon. The cowboy aesthetic was popularized by
              literature, theater and later on cinema, from the dime novels of the late 1800s to the classic Hollywood
              western films of the mid-20th century. Spaghetti Westerns, a genre of Western films produced in Italy,
              also had an important role in shaping the Cowboy theme and its aesthetics.
            </p>
            <p> The Cowboy theme continues to be a popular and enduring cultural style, seen in various forms of media,
              including film, television, and video games. Even today, the cowboy archetype remains a timeless symbol of
              American frontier spirit and individualism.

            <h5 class="issue" id="section4.2">Inspirtation Sources</h5>
            <p>The Cowboy theme in Technaissance project draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including classic
              Hollywood Westerns, Spaghetti Westerns and also the rugged individualism of the cowboy archetype.
            </p>
            <p> Classic Hollywood Westerns, starring actors like Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, and Roy Rogers, helped to
              popularize the cowboy aesthetic and establish many of the visual and thematic elements associated with the
              genre. These films often featured iconic imagery such as gunslingers, horseback rides, and wide-open
              landscapes that are now considered classic elements of the cowboy aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p> Spaghetti Westerns also had a big influence on the cowboy theme, introducing new ways of filming,
              editing, music and story-telling, bringing a different perspective to the American Western genre. This
              made the cowboy theme more epic and romantic, with a touch of violence.

            <h5 class="issue" id="section4.3">Mood-Board For Theme</h5>
            <p>We used a Pinterest moodboard for the Cowboy theme. It is heavily inspired by classic Hollywood Westerns
              and Spaghetti Westerns. The moodboard captures the various visual and aesthetic elements associated with
              the Cowboy genre, providing inspiration for the overall look and feel of the theme. It features imagery
              such as rugged landscapes, horses, guns, and cowboy hats, which are all iconic elements of the cowboy
              aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p> The moodboard also includes pictures of main actors of Hollywood Westerns and Spaghetti Westerns, such
              as Clint Eastwood, who embodies the spirit of the cowboy archetype.

                user experience, while still achieving the desired aesthetic of the cowboy theme. The design system is
                focused on the use of Bootstrap's grid layout system, providing flexibility and adaptability to
                different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that the page looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
                devices.

              </p>
              <p>HEADERS AND THEIR WEIGHTS</p>
